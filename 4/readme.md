#Task 4

Add visualizations and style the UI the best you can.
Try to implement a non-standard visualization that exposes some interesting connection between the entities.

You should use a visualization library.

NOTE: The solution to this task has to be done in the same folder as Task 2 and Task 3 called `solution2` and has to be squashed into 1 commit.
This means that the folder `solution2` will have both the solutions for **Task 2**, **Task 3** and **Task 4** and it will have 3 commits, 
one for each task.
