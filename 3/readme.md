#Task 3

Add the second and third sources to the solution of Task 2.

The additional entities you have to consume are called **Councils** and **Affairs**.

The sorting/filtering for the Councils has to be done on property `Name`.

The sorting/filtering for the Affairs has to be done on property `Date`.

NOTE: The solution to this task has to be done in the same folder as Task 2 called `solution2` and has to be squashed into 1 commit.
This means that the folder `solution2` will have both the solutions for **Task 2** and **Task 3** and it will have 2 commits, 
one for each task.
